[WIP] mvRx_Playground

Simple usage of MvRx by AirBnB (https://github.com/airbnb/MvRx) fetching gitHub 'Square' respositories, using AAC, clean arch, and Koein.

This codebase is used for code examples my talk 'Nitrogen in your Test Pyramid' as a good use case for UI-Unit tests.


-> It's still WIP.
